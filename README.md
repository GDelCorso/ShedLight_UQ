# ShedLight_UQ - WIP

This git is going to contain the (Python) software and utilities to implement several types of intrusive/semi-intrusive/non-intrusive Bayesian probabilistic neural networks.

The code is provided with a large number of comments and remarks about toy problems in the**Notebook_Jupyter** folder.

Generated data are saved in **Data** folder.

The theory related to the implemented code can be found in the paper: [Shedding light on uncertainties in machine learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388256801_Shedding_light_on_uncertainties_in_machine_learning_formal_derivation_and_optimal_model_selection?utm_content=spotlight&utm_source=spotlightDetails&rgutm_meta1=SPL%3A679202aa4a4e592f920d4791&_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QiLCJwYWdlIjoicHJvZmlsZSJ9fQ)
